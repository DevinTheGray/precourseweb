<h3> Career, Hopes, and Dreams </h3>
<p> Honestly I'm not totally sure what type of job I want after this. I know I want something exciting that hopefully pays well but that's about all I know in the moment. I just want to be happy, and doing some good in the world. I am extremely excited to start a new future with skills that will open so many different doors for me. I would really love to get a job that allows
time for travel. It would be so cool to go anywehre in the world I want as long as I have a computer to use to get work done. I'm ready to get my groove on.  </p>
