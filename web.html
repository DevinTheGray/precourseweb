          <h2> Where am I from? </h2>
          <p>I am a Colorado native! I was born in Littleton and moved with my parents to Denver when I was in highschool. After that I went to CU Boulder and lived up in Boulder for four years. Now I am back in Denver! </p>

  <h2> Family </h2>
<p> My immediate family includes me, my mom Kirsten, my dad Jeff, and my older brother Taylor. My dad is basically my best friend
  because he also shares my love of dad jokes, and luckily is more clumsy than I am
    so he makes me look good.
  My extended family is actually really really weird. My Dad doesn't talk to most of his family, they mostly live in Maine. Ive never met anyone on his side of the family. I do know that my Dad's sister was wanted for murder at one point and my parents were going to have to
  adopt her 4 kids, due to the fact their dad was missing... presumably murdered by my aunt.
I'm not toally sure how that situaiton resloved itself.  I think my dad's cousin Ira was on an episode of Iceroad Truckers so that's cool.
We are really close with my mom's sister and her family though. I have two cousins on that side, one is 10 and the other 13. I have 17 year old twin Uncles because my Grandpa on my mom's side married a woman only 5 years older than my mom. It was his 6th marriage.
I think that makes my mom feel uncomfortable... </p>
